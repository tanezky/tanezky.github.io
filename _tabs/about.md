### Why I Created This Site

Friends and colleagues have been nudging me to share my tech experiments for a while. It's been on my "someday" list, but I'm finally going to start with it.

My main goal here is to create a personal knowledge base.  I'm tired of tutorials vanishing from the web just when I need them again, or trying to find some specific site which I remember vaguely consumes a lot of time. Organizing and keeping over 2000 bookmarks takes time as well and in many situations the article I'm trying to find has been already disappeared.

I'll be referencing original sources whenever possible.  After all, I don't deserve credit for someone else's great work. If you find something useful here, please give credit where it's suitable.

Instead of a traditional blog, I decided to give Github Pages a shot. Since I use git every day, it felt like a natural fit.

**TL;DR:** This site is mainly for me, but you're welcome to look around.
