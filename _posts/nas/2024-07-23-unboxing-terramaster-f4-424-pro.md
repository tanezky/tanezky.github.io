_Overview of accessories_

The TerraMaster F4-424 Pro comes with a modest accessory kit:

- Power supply unit (PSU)
- Ethernet cable
- Screws: For mounting 2.5" drives
- Stickers: For labeling drive bays

Instead of a comprehensive manual, TerraMaster includes information about their limited warranty, compensation promises, and a quick installation guide that directs users to their [website](https://support.terra-master.com/quickguide/steps?product=F4-424%20Pro) for detailed instructions.

The included power supply unit has an output of 12 VDC and 7.5 A, delivering a maximum of 90 Watts of power.

_Official instructions on NVME installation_
Two NVMe slots are located internally, requiring removal of two screws and the side panel to access the motherboard. While this design provides a clean exterior, it might be a minor inconvenience for frequent upgrades or maintenance.

## Conclusion

Overall, the TerraMaster F4-424 Pro feels solidly built, with rubber feet and a weight of 3.4 kilograms (diskless) that should help minimize vibrations – a plus for hard drive longevity. However, the 120 mm fan at the back raises a few concerns about placement. It blows air directly out the rear, meaning the device can't be placed too close to a wall or in a shallow shelf. 

The discrepancy between advertised and officially supported memory capacity also gives pause, and I'll be looking closely at actual performance later. But on first glance, this NAS seems like a promising contender for my homelab upgrade.
